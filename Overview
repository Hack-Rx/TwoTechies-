# TwoTechies-
This webapp is a part of the hackathon project
We are trying to develop a webapp titled - 'SatarkCorona' with the motto of "We'll get thru this,together!"
The webapp is a COVID-19 symptom checker app which will predict the risk of the end-user suffering from coronavirus. We wish to enhance the efficiency
of our app by adding more in-built functions to it.

We wish to contribute our bit to the society at times of crisis like these:)
